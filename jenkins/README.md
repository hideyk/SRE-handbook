## Introduction

Jenkins is the leading open source automation server with hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project. With Jenkins, organizations can accelerate the software development process by automating it. Jenkins manages and controls software delivery processes throughout the entire lifecycle, including build, document, test, package, stage, deployment, static code analysis and much more!

You can set up Jenkins to watch for any code changes in places like GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab and automatically do a build with tools like Maven and Gradle. You can utilize container technology such as Docker and Kubernetes, initiate tests and then take actions like rolling back in production.

### Jenkins History

The Jenkins project was started in 2005 (originally called Hudson) by Kohsuke Kawaguchi, while he worked for Sun Microsystems. Kohsuke was a developer at Sun and got tired of incurring the wrath of his team every time his code broke the build. He created Jenkins as a way to perform continuous integration - that is, to test his code before he did an actual commit to the repository, to be sure all was well. He soon open sourced it, creating the Jenkins project.
