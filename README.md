# SRE Development

Herein lies my personal journey into becoming a full-fledged Site Reliability Engineer.

## Project Structure

For each SRE enabling tool, its folder will contain a couple of files which prescriptively provide knowledge on operationalizing it in a production setting. 

- README.md - General information & best practices
- SETUP.md - Instructions on how to set-up the SRE tool on multiple platforms (Typically Ubuntu, Fedora, Windows)
- CONFIG.md - Configuring your tool to fit your organization use-case
- USECASES.md - Examples of using the SRE tool in production
- MONITOR.md - How to monitor the tool and ensure that everything is running smoothly
