## Introduction
Python is an interpreted high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

## Characteristics

<ins>High-level</ins>

> Strong abstraction from the details of the computer. Rather than dealing with registers, memory addresses and call stacks, HLLs deal with variables, arrays, objects, complex arithmetic, subroutines, threads and functions with a focus on usability over optimal program efficiency. 

<ins>Interpreted</ins>

> An interpreted language executes instructions directly without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions. Debugging occurs at run-time and typically delivers relatively slower performance. 

<ins>Dynamically typed</ins>

> Interpreter assisns variables a type at runtime based on the variable's value, instead of during compilation (statically typed)

<ins>Garbage-collected</ins>

> Automatically deallocates objects which are no longer needed. 

<br>

The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document [](), which includes aphorisms such as:
- Beautiful is better than ugly
- Explicit is better than implicit
- Simple is better than complex
- Complex is better than complicated
- Readability counts
